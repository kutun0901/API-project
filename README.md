# Welcome to my Airbnb clone website

Link: https://tuanbnb.onrender.com/

This is a clone of the popular Airbnb website that was developed as a proof reflecting my knowledge gained from AppAcademy in the past 4 months.

The project uses a range of technologies for both the frontend and backend components. For the backend, the project uses JavaScript, Sequelize, Express, and SQLITE. For the frontend, the project uses HTML, CSS, React, and Redux. The project currently has three major features:
+ User management
+ Spot management
+ Review management. 
Each of these features provides full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data as needed.

## The landing page

## Spot details page

In the future, the project may be expanded to include additional features such as spot images, review images, user profiles, a booking feature, and a landing page for the website.

To get started with the project, interested users can download or clone the repository, navigate to the backend directory and run "npm install", then navigate to the frontend directory and run "npm install". Finally, running "npm start" in both the backend and frontend directories will start the project, which can be accessed by navigating to localhost:3000 in a web browser.
